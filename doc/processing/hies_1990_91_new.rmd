```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Let's import the data 

```{r}
hesbas.char <- scan("./Data/HESBAS.DAT",what="")
```
Now let's turn into matrix

```{r}
hesbas.mat <- str_split(hesbas.char,"",simplify=T)
```

Now let's bring in record type 

```{r}
rectype <- read.csv("./Data/rectype.csv",stringsAsFactors = F)
```

Then following changes have been done 

```{r}
rectype[,1:dim(rectype)[2]]<-lapply(
                                 rectype[,1:dim(rectype)[2]],
                                      function(x) {
                     x[grepl("^\\s*$",x)] <- NA;return(x)})
```
